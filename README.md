# IgiLoad
Modifications to support Epoch and blckeagls
I take no credit for creating IgiLoad which was originally developed by igi_pl.

I have made modifications to the IgiLoad.sqf to add epoch vehicles and to add loading of crates onto SDV (subs).
To use, just replace or current IgiLoad with the one downloaded here and you should be good to go.
If you have already modified IgiLoad just merge the one here with yours as appropriate. 
This update supports vehicles Epoch 1.2.0, blckeagls mission system, Town invasions, and several Arma vehicles.
